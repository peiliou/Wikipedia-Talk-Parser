# Wikipedia-Talk-Parser

## Description

A generalized **Wikipedia Talk** parser with metadata and configurations available 

- It backtracks the entire conversation (with metadata) of a comment the user wants to reply to
- Comment metadata format (if available)
```
author: string
id: string
level: int
replies: array
timestamp: date
type: string
```

## Parser Configurations (in the source code)
```
"include_title":false,         //include section title of a talk
"bind_comments_to_users":true, //all comments are associated with inferred users using timestamp
"remove_comment_info":true,    //remove comment username and timestamp
"debug": false,                //troubleshooting only
```

## Getting Started
1. Download [Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net) suitable to your browser

2. [Install](https://github.com/peiliou/Wikipedia-Talk-Parser/raw/main/Userscript.user.js) Userscript.user.js

3. Go to any wikipedia talk page -> open web developer tools-> switch to the console tab -> the console will show parsed results when a reply button is clicked on a wiki talk page

4. Continue adding code inside the userscript to process the parsed results for further development

**Alternatively, you can also use it as a library (see example files in the [lib](https://github.com/peiliou/Wikipedia-Talk-Parser/tree/main/lib) folder)**

## Parser Algorithm
- It starts by checking if the comment is at the root level, since the comment DOM layout at the root level is different from other levels
- It creates deep copies of original nodes to process them without side effects
- Starting from the selected comment, it backtracks its preceding comment until the root level is reached
   - All comments preceding it at the same level are traversed before jumping back towards the root level
   - Comment texts (with or without the comment info) and metadata of all traversed comments are saved
- After reaching the root level, it traverses backwards until the section title is reached
   - Comment texts (with or without the comment info) and metadata of all traversed comments are saved

### Helper Functions

`remove_nested_comments(node, metadata)`: remove all non-primary comments of `node` and add metadata of the first comment to `metadata`

`prepend_if_valid(stack, node)`: add `node` into the `stack`
   >- Configurations available
   >- Validation checking
   >- Catches some edge cases
   >- Calls the helper function `preprocess(node)`

`preprocess(node)`: remove noises of `node`
   >- Configurations available
   >- Catches some edge cases
   >- Permits clean usage of `node.innerText`
